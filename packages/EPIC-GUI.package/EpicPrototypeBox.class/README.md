I am the PrototypeBox. I encapsulate an EpicTabBar and an EpicPrototypePanel and thus form the left half of the window. My brother, the EditorBox, does the same with the EditorPanel and NavigationBar. I also have additional PrototypePanels as my submorphs, but they are only displayed if a corresponding TabButton in my TanBar is pressed.
