EpicMenu acts like a DockingBarMenuMorph with the exeption that filtering of the MenuItens through keyboard input is disabled.

The reason for that is that certain panels in the menu want to activate and deactivate on their own (depending on the state or states of one or more components) - for example the option to starting and stopping the simulation.
