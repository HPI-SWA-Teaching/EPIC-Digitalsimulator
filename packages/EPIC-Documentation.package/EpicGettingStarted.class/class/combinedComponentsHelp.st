<p>Epic: Program for Integrated Circuits allows you to create your own custom components. These new components consists can only consist of the default components, but already allow for nearly limitless customizablity.</p>

<p>To create a custom component first of all build your custom circuit. Than select the components that should be combined and use the "Combine selected components" option in the "edit" menu bar tab or in the "combine components" in the yellow-click (right-click) menu. You can enter the name of your custom gate and press accept to combine and save the new component.</p>

<p>To edit a custom component simply double click on it. It will open the subcircuit as a different tab. To go back to the main circuit rightmost tab label ontop of the Editor Panel.</p>

<p>Already created custom components can be loaded from the CUSTOM-tab of the Prototype Panel. Custom componets are saved in the "epic" folder inside the Squeak resources. Therefore they can also be loaded as own complete circuit.</p>')
